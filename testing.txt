When creating Item randomItem(int choice); It was because during my process in chosing the proposal I stated items can be looted and switched and players are able to switch them during the simulation
0 creates a weapon and returns a item temp with a weapon
1 creates a armor and returns item temp with a armor
other wise it returns a item temp which in thise case would be anything that isnt 1 or 0 which would be a potion
This ensures that a temp will always be returned when calling this function

When creating the trading function I came accross an error "terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::length_error'
  what():  basic_string::_M_create" I thought it was due to way I was reading the file so I changed it and then I thought it was the function itself so I added more precautions and still came across it but it was because vectors read from 0 and my random Party member function was giving random
  numbers between 1-10 when the vector reads from 0-9 off by one...
