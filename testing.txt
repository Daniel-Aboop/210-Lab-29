When creating Item randomItem(int choice); It was because during my process in chosing the proposal I stated items can be looted and switched and players are able to switch them during the simulation
0 creates a weapon and returns a item temp with a weapon
1 creates a armor and returns item temp with a armor
other wise it returns a item temp which in thise case would be anything that isnt 1 or 0 which would be a potion
This ensures that a temp will always be returned when calling this function
