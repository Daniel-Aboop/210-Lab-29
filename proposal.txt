//Include headers for file handling the data structures, etc

//Define functions to simulate a players invetorys changes throughout gameplay ex: trading, item durability, invetory status, looting items
    //Parameters: the std::map for player invetory, number of simulations which can occur random events such as listed above

//Define struct Item to hold Item information for players invetory, EACH player invetory holds 3 Items: Armor, Weapon, Potion
    // Information for items wil include 
        //Item name etc: Sword, Healing Potion, Axe, Shield
        //Durability
        //Rarity

//Define main functions
    //Make the map which will store player invetory information, The username will be the key, size 3 array with a list of structs 
      // weapons, armor, potions 

    //Read data from a file to populate the map
        // If file doenst open print error and return -1;

    //The format will be be Player name,
        //then will be the 3 items and the information for them, 
            //  Item name
                //Durability
                    //Rarity
        // Insert this data inside the lists 

    //Close the file

    //Begin the simulation
        // Random events for our players will happen 
            // For 30 intervals 
                // Per player randomly decide if they want to trade an item to a different player meaning
                    // Player 1 has an axe Player 2 has a sword they trade their weapons with each other
                //Looting items, If Item has a higher rarity swap it out and get rid of the old item.
                //Item durability, Random Durability usage such as using a sword or potion will cause the durability to go down
                    // If Durability goes to 0 item will break. and item durability wont apply for the item until they replace it
                //Repair Item
                    // will add +1 more usage to either weapon or armor or potion 
                // Robbed by thieves
                    // Player will loose all items in invetory and wont be affected by any of the things above until they can replace items.
                //Replacing items
                    // Player will randomly replace their items. allowing them to be affected by the events again, the looting items event will always be active
        // Trading 60% Chance
        //Looting items 40% Chance
        //Item Durability -1 30% Chance
        //Repair Item +1  30% Chance
        //Robbed by Thieves 5% 
        //Replacing items 50% -- Only happens if robbed by thieves or item breaks

        //Print out every players invetory at the end of each iterations and then repeat
    
// End of main functions
