When creating the trading function I came accross an error "terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::length_error'
  what():  basic_string::_M_create" I thought it was due to way I was reading the file so I changed it and then I thought it was the function itself so I added more precautions and still came across it but it was because vectors read from 0 and my random Party member function was giving random
  numbers between 1-10 when the vector reads from 0-9 off by one...

  Had to add checks for every function to properly output data if the item was robbed or not. Since it wasnt outputting everything

  passed the vector names as a const reference 

  For clairty I changed the randomItem function to produce a random item to always return a Item struct.

  Attempted to do the effect to wait a couple seconds before each iteration, wasnt able to reproduce it.

  Fixed the check durability if statement as it should make the rarity 0 if its a broken item along with the itemname being gone.

  Added comment that says use PartyData.txt for testing and also using this program.
